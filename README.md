## Project Description
I, along with some of my classmates at Qazvin International University, found out that the bus service system of the university has problems, for example, there is no ticket reservation system for students, and this caused crowding in the bus park area. Also, the students did not know exactly when the bus service would arrive and were delayed. That's why we decided to develop Uniway system for university bus service. This system is being developed for three categories of people, namely students, bus drivers and administrators. I'm responsible for the drivers panel front-end and you can see it above.
(Note: This panel is for only university bus drivers who have already registered, so other people cannot login to it)
